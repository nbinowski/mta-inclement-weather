This repository holds the Exploratory Data Analysis results for Project 1 for the Metis Data Analytics Bootcamp.

This project is intended to be on behalf of the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) in support of its efforts to increase ridership, and thus increase revenue.  The MTA Inclement Weather Impacts Study performed in August 2021 on 2019 MTA Ridership and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate data sought to analyze the impacts of inclement weather on MTA subway ridership.  If a strong correlation were found between ridership and precipitation and high and low temperatures, capital investments to improve subway stations could be made and targeted marketing campaigns could be created to positively impact ridership.

The repository contains the Jupyter notebook used in the analysis, the CSV file containing the NOAA weather data, a one-page project writeup and a project presentation.
